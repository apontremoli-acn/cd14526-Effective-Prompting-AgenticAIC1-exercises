       "The Special Theory of Relativity addresses the physics of objects moving at constant velocities, particularly those approaching the speed of light. It rests upon two postulates: first, that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference; second, that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the light source or observer. From these premises arise remarkable consequences, such as time dilation—the slowing of time for a moving clock relative to a stationary observer—and length contraction, wherein objects in motion appear shortened along the direction of travel. Moreover, it establishes the equivalence of mass and energy, succinctly expressed in the iconic equation \\( E = mc^2 \\).\n",

       "The General Theory of Relativity, on the other hand, is a profound extension that encompasses gravitation. It supplants the Newtonian conception of gravity as a force acting at a distance with the notion that mass and energy curve the very fabric of spacetime, and that this curvature governs the motion of bodies. In essence, gravity is geometry. This theory has yielded predictions such as the bending of light by gravitational fields, the precession of planetary orbits, and the gravitational redshift of light—all of which have found experimental confirmation, elevating confidence in the theory's validity.\n",
